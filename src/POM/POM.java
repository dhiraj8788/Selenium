	 * 	POM (Page Object Model)
	 * 
	 * 		It is a java design pattern used for design of classes in Test script. 
			Page Object model is an object design pattern in Selenium,where

	1. Web pages are represented as classes(No of webpages=No of POM Classes).

	2. The various elements on the webpage are defined as variables in the class.

		POM Strictly follows encapsulation concept where,

	1. Data members/Global Variables should be declared globally with access level private by using @findby 

	@FindBy: 
			An annotation used in page factory to locate and declare webelements using different locators


	2. Initialize within a constructor with access level public using pagefactory

	3. Utilize within a method with access level public
	
	We have to create method in POM class to perform actions and call it in other class where main method is there
